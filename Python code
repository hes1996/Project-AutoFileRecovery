This is a Python script that will take a disk image as an input, 
locate file signatures, properly recover user generated files without 
corruption, and generate a SHA-256 hash for each file recovered.

import objects
import re

# taking in the disk image
with open ("Project2Updated.dd", 'rb') as f:
       data = f.read()

# locate file signatures
'''
this should find all the file types except mpg and jpg
fileSig1 = re.findall('(%PDF|BM|GIF87a|GIF89a|PK..|PK......|AVI LIST|%PNG....)', data)

this should find mpg
fileSig2 = re.findall('00 00 01 BX', data)

this should find jpg
fileSig3 = re.findall('FF D9', data)

I found two links that might help:

https://github.com/PacktPublishing/Python-Digital-Forensics-Cookbook/blob/
master/Chapter01/hashing.py

https://github.com/nneonneo/ntfsrecover/blob/master/ntfsrecover.py

See if you can make sense of these because I am super confused.
